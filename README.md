# The NEW Music Request System
It might not be so new by the time you are reading this, but this is the repository for version 3 of the Music Request System (MRS) software. The previous 2.x releases can be found in the legacy repo: https://github.com/sultansofsweat/music-request-system-legacy, which will continue to see updates as they are required.

The Music Request System was officially conceived in 2015. MRS 2 was released to the public in 2017. MRS 3 has yet to be released, but it is slowly getting there.

Note that the primary source of information is via the MRS' "official" website, which contains mostly MRS 2 information: https://firealarms.mooo.com/mrs
